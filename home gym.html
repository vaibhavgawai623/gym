        A gymnasium, also known as a gym, is an indoor location for athletics. The word is derived from the ancient
        Greek term "gymnasium".[1] They are commonly found in athletic and fitness centers, and as activity and learning
        spaces in educational institutions. "Gym" is also slang for "fitness centre", which is often an area for indoor
        recreation. A "gym" may include or describe adjacent open air areas as well. In Western countries, "gyms" (or
        pl: gymnasia") often describe places with indoor or outdoor courts for basketball, hockey, tennis, boxing or
        wrestling, and with equipment and machines used for physical development training, or to do exercises. In many
        European countries, Gymnasium (and variations of the word) also can describe a secondary school that prepares
        students for higher education at a university, with or without the presence of athletic courts, fields, or
        equipment.

        Gymnasia apparatus like barbells, jumping boards, running paths, tennis-balls, cricket fields, and fencing areas
        are used for exercises. In safe weather, outdoor locations are the most conducive to health.[2] Gyms were
        popular in ancient Greece. Their curricula included self-defense, gymnastics medica, or physical therapy to help
        the sick and injured, and for physical fitness and sports, from boxing to dancing to skipping rope.[3]

        Gymnasia also had teachers of wisdom and philosophy. Community gymnastic events were done as part of the
        celebrations during various village festivals. In ancient Greece there was a phrase of contempt, "He can neither
        swim nor write." After a while, however, Olympic athletes began training in buildings specifically designed for
        them.[4] Community sports never became as popular among ancient Romans as it had among the ancient Greeks. Gyms
        were used more as a preparation for military service or spectator sports. During the Roman Empire, the gymnastic
        art was forgotten. In the Dark Ages there were sword fighting tournaments and of chivalry; and after gunpowder
        was invented sword fighting began to be replaced by the sport of fencing, as well as schools of dagger fighting
        and wrestling and boxing.[5]

    <p> In the 18th century, Salzmann, German clergyman, opened a gym in Thuringia teaching bodily exercises,
    including
    running and swimming. Clias and Volker established gyms in London, and in 1825, Doctor Charles Beck, a German
    immigrant, established the first gymnasium in the United States. It was found that gym pupils lose interest in
    doing the same exercises, partly because of age. Variety in exercises included skating, dancing, and swimming.
    Some gym activities can be done by 6 to 8-year-olds while age 16 has been considered mature enough for boxing
    and horseback riding.[6]

    In Ancient Greece, the gymnasion (γυμνάσιον) was a locality for both physical and intellectual education of
    young men. The latter meaning of intellectual education persisted in Greek, German and other languages to denote
    a certain type of school providing secondary education, the gymnasium, whereas in English the meaning of
    physical education pertained in the word 'gym'.[7] The Greek word gymnasium, which means "school for naked
    exercise," was used to designate a locality for the education of young men, including physical education
    (gymnastics, for example, exercise) which was customarily performed naked, as well as bathing, and studies. For
    the Greeks, physical education was considered as important as cognitive learning. Most Greek gymnasia had
    libraries for use after relaxing in the baths.[citation needed]

    <h2>History</h2>

    <p>Children's outdoor gymnasium, circa 19th Century. The equipment, which was standard for the time, includes
        ladders, gymnastic horses, and parallel bars.
        The first recorded gymnasiums date back to over 3000 years ago in ancient Persia, where they were known as
        zurkhaneh, areas that encouraged physical fitness. The larger Roman Baths often had attached fitness facilities,
        the baths themselves sometimes being decorated with mosaics of local champions of sport. Gyms in Germany were an
        outgrowth of the Turnplatz,[8] an outdoor space for gymnastics founded by German educator Friedrich Jahn in
        1811[9] and later promoted by the Turners, a nineteenth-century political and gymnastic movement. The first
        American to open a public gym in the United States using Jahn's model was John Neal of Portland, Maine in
        1827.[10] The first indoor gymnasium in Germany was probably the one built in Hesse in 1852 by Adolph
        Spiess.[11]

        Through worldwide colonization, Great Britain expanded its national interest in sports and games to many
        countries. In the 1800s, programs were added to schools and college curricula that emphasized health, strength,
        and bodily measure. Sports drawn from European and British cultures thrived as college students and upper-class
        clubs financed competition. As a result, towns began building playgrounds that furthered interest in sports and
        physical activity.[12] Early efforts to establish gyms in the United States in the 1820s were documented and
        promoted by John Neal in the American Journal of Education[13] and The Yankee, helping to establish the American
        branch of the movement.[14] Later in the century, the Turner movement was founded and continued to thrive into
        the early twentieth century. The first Turners group was formed in London in 1848. The Turners built gymnasia in
        several cities like Cincinnati and St. Louis which had large German American populations. These gyms were
        utilized by adults and youth. For example, a young Lou Gehrig would frequent the Turner gym in New York City
        with his father.[15]

        Interior of a gym in the Netherlands, around 1900
        The Boston Young Men's Christian Union claims to be "America's First Gym". The YMCA first organized in Boston in
        1851 and a smaller branch opened in Rangasville in 1852.[16] Ten years later there were some two hundred YMCAs
        across the country, most of which provided gymnasia for exercise, games, and social interaction.[citation

        The 1920s was a decade of prosperity that witnessed the building of large numbers of public high schools with a
        gymnasium, an idea founded by Nicolas Isaranga.[citation needed]

        Today, gymnasia are commonplace in the United States. They are in virtually all U.S. colleges and high schools,
        as well as almost all middle schools and elementary schools. These facilities are used for physical education,
        intramural sports, and school gatherings. The number of gyms in the U.S. has more than doubled since the late
        1980s.[17]</p>
